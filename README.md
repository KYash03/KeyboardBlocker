# What it is:
It's a small macOS app that lets you disable your keyboard with a simple menu-bar toggle.

# How it works:
The app uses macOSâ€™s accessibility APIs to intercept and block keyboard events. When activated, it creates an event tap that stops any keystrokes from reaching your system until you disable it again.

# Why I created it:
I built this because I needed a way to clean my keyboard without accidentally hitting keys. While there are other solutions out there, many are closed-source and I was concerned about privacy. It turned out to be a fun and relatively simple project, so I decided to share my open source version with everyone.
